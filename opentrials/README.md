# Exploring OpenTrials

[OpenTrials](http://opentrials.net/) is a project by [Open Knowledge International](https://okfn.org/) to:

    ... locate, match, and share all publicly accessible data and documents, on all trials conducted, on all medicines and other treatments, globally.

In this notebook, we work with the OpenTrials API to inspect the type of data available, and show some simple ideas for how the data can be used.
