# Open Data Projects with Python

Learning to program can be easier when you have a problem to solve. The notebooks here are simple examples of working with open data to answer real world questions or problems.

## Skill level

The notebooks here are designed for those new to programming, and learning with Python.

Ideally, you'll be comfortable with the basics of Python syntax, and very basic debugging.

If you need a primer, start working through [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org).

## What you need

## Defining a problem

You'll find here some notebooks that seek to answer some simple 'problems' with open data.

The whole point of these examples to to help you find a starting point to answer your own questions.

However, if you are having trouble finding a place to start, here are some questions and problems to get you going.

1. How is money from the EU distributed throughout UK regions?
